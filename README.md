# Chloroplast Simulation

This is just an old matlab application made for simulating chloroplast values with set parameters in a research paper. I know it worked years ago when it was last used, but honestly can't really confirm or test anything at the moment. Thought I'd put it up in case anyone could get any use from it.

I may move things from the index notes to here, and clean things up.
